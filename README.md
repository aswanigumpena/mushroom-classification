# mushroom-classification
Problem Statement:
The adubon society field guide to north american mushrooms contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corrresponding to 23 speices of grilled mushrooms in the agricus and lepiota family mushroom.each secies labled as either definately edible,definetly poisionous,or my be edible but not recommonded,this last category was mereged with toxic category.the guide asserts uniquivocally that there is no simple rule for judjing a mushrooms ediblity such as leaflets three,leave it be for poisonous oak and lvy.

the main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous and which is edible.
